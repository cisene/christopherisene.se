There is several ways to contact me, but be sure it is for the right reason.

Email is the preferred way and since I have my phone with me all the time, I can check my email whenever.

Phone call is the least preferred method, it is invasive and are stealing time unless it&#8217;s really important. Think, &#8220;can this wait til tonight or tomorrow?&#8221;, if the answer is yes you should shot me an email instead.

If you are a recruiter, please, do not call. I&#8217;m generally not interested in what is offered. If you still feel that you absolutely need to reach me, send me an email. Thank you.
